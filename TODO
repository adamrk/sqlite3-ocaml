1) More testing

2) An even higher level function for execution of queries in a more
   convenient way. It should handle busy queries and expired 
   statements automatically.

3) TODO: Add the following wrappers:
 a) SQL Function support
 b) Collation support
 c) Authorization support
 d) Trace/profile support
 e) progress handler support
 f) commit hook support
 g) global_recover,get_autocommit,db_handle,temp_directory 
 h) encryption support (not in SQLite anyway)

4) Better documentation
