2007-03-19: Fixed an installation problem on Cygwin.

            Thanks to James Cheney <james.cheney@gmail.com> for the hint!

2007-02-27: Small API-change: the callback for exec is now an optional
            argument.

            Added three more "exec"-functions, which do or do not take
            headers or handle NULL-values.

            Improved quality of C-code (removed warnings).

2007-02-23: Fixed a bug in the "db_close"-function.  Improved documentation.

2007-02-19: Added check for out of memory after malloc.

2007-01-31: Fixed build problem on x86_64: added -fPIC flag to compilation
            of C-stubs.

2007-01-17: Complete rewrite by Markus Mottl <markus.mottl@gmail.com>.
