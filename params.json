Sqlite3 is a self-contained,\r\nserverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine with\r\noutstanding performance for many use cases.\r\n\r\nThese bindings are written in a way that enables a friendly coexistence with\r\nthe old (version 2) SQLite and its OCaml wrapper `ocaml-sqlite`.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe API in file `lib/sqlite3.mli` is fully documented, and HTML-documentation\r\ncan be built using `make doc` and installed with this distribution.  It can\r\nalso be found [online](http://mmottl.github.io/sqlite3-ocaml/api).\r\n\r\nSQLite3 has its own [online documentation](http://www.sqlite.org/docs.html).\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nThe `test`-directory in this distribution contains a few simple examples\r\nfor testing various features of this library.\r\n\r\n### Build issues\r\n\r\nSQLite3-OCaml depends on `pkg-config` to locate and compile against an\r\n[SQLite3](http://www.sqlite.org) library.\r\n\r\nIf the SQLite3 version is greater than or equal to 3.3.7, it is assumed that it\r\nsupports [Run-Time Loadable Extensions](http://www.sqlite.org/loadext.html).\r\nIf this feature has been explicitly disabled in the library, building\r\napplications will fail with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUndefined symbols for architecture ...:\r\n  \"_sqlite3_enable_load_extension\", referenced from:\r\n      _caml_sqlite3_enable_load_extension in libsqlite3_stubs.a(sqlite3_stubs.o)\r\n     (maybe you meant: _caml_sqlite3_enable_load_extension)\r\n```\r\n\r\n  * You can check if your library is missing loadable extensions by searching\r\n    it for the string `OMIT_LOAD_EXTENSION`.\r\n\r\n  * If you need to change where `pkg-config` will look for the SQLite3\r\n    library, set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to the new\r\n    directory.  This can be automated by setting the `SQLITE3_OCAML_BREWCHECK`\r\n    environment variable; this will instruct the build to see if a _brewed_\r\n    version of SQLite is installed and route `pkg-config` appropriately.\r\n\r\n  * You can explicitly disable run-time loadable extensions by calling\r\n    `configure` with the flag `--disable-loadable-extensions` or by setting\r\n    the environment variable `SQLITE3_DISABLE_LOADABLE_EXTENSIONS` if linking\r\n    problems persist.\r\n\r\n  * Due to frequent installation issues with loadable extensions on Mac OS X,\r\n    the default there is to disable them.  You will have to explicitly enable\r\n    them on that platform.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\n  * Enrico Tassi contributed support for user-defined scalar functions.\r\n\r\n  * Markus Mottl rewrote Christian's bindings for Jane Street Holding, LLC to\r\n    clean up a few things and to make it perform better in multi-threaded\r\n    environments.\r\n\r\n  * Christian Szegedy wrote the initial release for SQLite version 3.\r\n\r\n  * Mikhail Fedotov wrote ocaml-sqlite for SQLite version 2.  His bindings\r\n    served as a reference for this wrapper, but sqlite3 is written completely\r\n    from scratch since the C interface changed significantly.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nContact Information and Contributing\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn the case of bugs, feature requests, contributions and similar,\r\nplease communicate with the maintainers using the [GitHub project\r\npage](https://github.com/mmottl/sqlite3-ocaml).\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nMarkus Mottl on June 14, 2016\r\n",
